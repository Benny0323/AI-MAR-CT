 Collection of deep learning-based metal artifact reduction articles for CT/CBCT Imaging

**Simulation-driven training of vision transformers enables
metal artifact reduction of highly truncated CBCT scans** \
F. Fan et al.\
**Summary** \
The paper proposes to use Swin-transformer for metal segmentation in the projection domain for CBCT data. Simulation data is used for the training. U-Net is shown to work best when the test data is similiar to the train data. But when the test data source is different than training, Swin transformer performs better.\

 **Quad-Net: Quad-domain Network for CT Metal Artifact Reduction** \
*Z. Li et al.* \
**Summary** \
In addition to the dual domain artifact reduction in sinogram and image domain, the paper proposed to also apply Fourier domain processing of features in sinogram and image domain, respectively.\
