 **PND-Net: Physics-inspired Non-local Dual-domain Network for Metal Artifact Reduction**  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Unsupervised-blue.svg" alt="Unsupervised"> \
 *J. Xia et al.* \
 **Summary**\
 The authors propose to use three networks. One is called non-local sinogram decomposition network (NSD-Net) to acquire the weighted artifact component in sinogram domain. The second network is an image restoration network (IR-Net) to reduce the residual and secondary artifacts in the image domain. The third trainable fusion network (F-Net) in the artifact synthesis path is used for unpaired learning. The method is compared with linear interpolation, NMAR, DuDoNet, DuDoNet++, InDuDoNet+, ADN, and U-DuDoNet.\

**Dual Domain Diffusion Guidance for 3D CBCT Metal Artifact Reduction**  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Supervised-blue.svg" alt="Supervised"> \
*Y. Choi et al.* \
**Summary** \
The authors propose to use two 2D diffusion models in image domain to synthesize metal artifacts and metal free images, respectively. The combination of metal artifact and metal free images is forward projected and a guidance from the error in the projection domain is used. The results are compared with InDuDoNet+, ACDNet, FEL, and Blind DPS methods.  \

 **Quad-Net: Quad-domain Network for CT Metal Artifact Reduction** <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Supervised-blue.svg" alt="Supervised"> \
*Z. Li et al.* \
**Summary** \
In addition to the dual domain artifact reduction in sinogram and image domain, the paper proposed to also apply Fourier domain processing of features in sinogram and image domain, respectively.\

**Unsupervised metal artifacts reduction network for CT images based on
efficient transformer** <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Unsupervised-blue.svg" alt="Unsupervised"> \
*L. Zhu et al.*\
**Summary**
A method to incorporate efficient Transformer blocks in the two generators of the CycleGAN. Additionally, the method also includes a loss term for the forward projections in the non-metal area. The results are compared with linear interpolation, CycleGAN and ADN.\

**Simulation-driven training of vision transformers enables
metal artifact reduction of highly truncated CBCT scans** \
*F. Fan et al.* <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Supervised-blue.svg" alt="Supervised"> \
**Summary** \
The paper proposes to use Swin-transformer for metal segmentation in the projection domain for CBCT data. Simulation data is used for the training. U-Net is shown to work best when the test data is similiar to the train data. But when the test data source is different than training, Swin transformer performs better.\

*H. Agrawal et al.* \
**Summary** \
The authors propose to use Gated Convoltuions for the metal area inpainting in the projection domain. The method is compared against linear interpolation, U-Net, and Partial Convolutions. \
